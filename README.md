# Event Tracker Project
### Overview
'Event Tracker' is a broad term for anything that keeps track of information over time. Examples of these applications are 'Mint' (financial tracking) and 'MyFitnessPal' (diet and exercise tracker). These are very involved applications with a huge feature set.

You are embarking on a weekend project that you may or may not come back to afterwards, thus we would caution you to limit your scope significantly. Examples of limited scope would be 'Gas Tracker' (keep track of your fill ups and total mileage to determine dollar/gallon in your car) or 'Timesheet' (track time in and time out to calculate total hours at some rate of pay).

### Learning Objectives
Create a JPA Project

Create a Java entity class POJO that models your database table.
Map your POJO using JPA.
Configure a Spring Boot app to publish a REST API.

Use Spring REST annotations.
Use Spring Data JPA to perform all CRUD operations.
Send and receive JSON.

### Goal
Your objective for this project should be to do as much as you can. That is not to say as many features, but as much as you actually understand.

Do not move onto the next step until you actually know what you just did and feel comfortable with what is happening. If you reach a point and are confused about what you are doing, or what you have done, ask questions, look for resources, or start over on that piece to ensure that you are comfortable with it.

Make sure to commit and push once you have an MVP with full CRUD operations working.

Stretch Goals
JUnit tests for your repository, service, and controller layers.
Supplemental tables, mappings, and controller routes for nested CRUD.
